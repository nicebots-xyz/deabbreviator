# Botkit: An Advanced Framework for Crafting Sophisticated Discord Bots with py-cord

## What is Botkit?

Botkit is a comprehensive framework designed for developing feature-rich,
production-ready Discord bots. It goes beyond basic bot creation by offering a suite of
advanced tools and integrations that empower developers to build sophisticated,
scalable, and maintainable bots.

Key features include:

- **Robust Internationalization (i18n)**: Built-in support for multi-language bots,
  allowing seamless localization across diverse Discord communities.
- **Bot Listing Integration**: Streamlined processes for managing your bot's presence on
  popular bot listing websites, enhancing discoverability.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Sentry-compatible error tracking, enabling real-time
  monitoring and debugging of your bot in production environments. (Sentry is an
  application monitoring platform that helps developers identify and fix crashes in real
  time.)
- **Uptime Status Posting**: Automated systems for reporting your bot's operational
  status, crucial for maintaining user trust and meeting service level agreements.
- **Modular Architecture**: A flexible, extension-based structure that facilitates easy
  feature addition and management.

While Botkit provides a rich set of advanced features, it maintains a balance between
functionality and efficiency, offering a powerful yet not overly cumbersome development
experience.

## What Botkit is NOT

Botkit is not a pre-built, out-of-the-box Discord bot solution. It's a sophisticated
framework and starting point for developers looking to create advanced, custom Discord
bots. Botkit is designed for those who need more than basic functionality and are ready
to leverage its powerful features to create truly unique and capable bots.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The bot is designed with a modular architecture, allowing you to
  easily enable or disable specific extensions or features.
- **Extensible**: The bot is built around the extensions located in the `src/extensions`
  directory. There you can find useful and example extensions to get you started.
- **Configurable**: The bot's configuration, including enabled extensions and bot token,
  is managed through a `config.yml` file.
- **Easy Setup**: Botkit simplifies the setup process by providing a well-structured
  project template and configuration management.
- **Integrated Backend**: Botkit provides an easy way of having a Quart (flask-like)
  webserver running alongside your bot, with the ability to add routes and endpoints.
- **Useful Scripts**: Botkit includes useful scripts for managing your bot's listing on
  top.gg and other bot lists, such as discord's app directory.

## Requirements

- [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) - A modern Python packaging and dependency
  management tool.
- Python 3.11
- A Discord bot. You can create a new bot and get a token from the
  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pdm`:

```
pdm install
```

## Getting Started

When creating your own features, you’re supposed to create a new extension in the
`src/extensions` directory for each feature you want to add. To get started, you can
follow the guide available [here](guides/getting-started.md).

## Setup

### Automatic Extensions Configuration

Every extension in the `src/extensions` directory will automatically be loaded, and if
its default config is set to `enabled: true`, it will be enabled by default. This allows
you to add an extension that you found online simply by adding the file to the
`src/extensions` directory. The settings are automatically added to the `config.yml`
file if you didn't provide them, after running the bot.

### Yaml Configuration

You can set up the `config.yml` file with your bot token and desired extensions. There,
or trough environment variables, you can enable or disable extensions, set up the bot
token, and configure other options. You’re required to at least provide the bot token.
Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
extensions:
  listings:
    enabled: false
    topgg_token: "your_top.gg_token"
  ping:
    enabled: true
bot:
  token: "your_bot_token"
logging:
  level: INFO
```

### Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can set the bot token and other configuration options using
environment variables. You can set any variable as you would in the `config.yml` file,
but with the `BOTKIT__` prefix, and `__` to separate nested keys. To set lists, use
regular json syntax.

```env
BOTKIT__bot__token=your_bot_token
BOTKIT__extensions__listings__enabled=false
BOTKIT__extensions__listings__topgg_token=your_top.gg_token
BOTKIT__extensions__ping__enabled=true
BOTKIT__logging__level=INFO
```

## Creating Extensions

Extensions are in truth just python located in the `src/extensions` directory. When
creating an extension, it is crucial to follow the following guidelines:

- You should keep only one feature per extension.
- Creating multiple files and submodules is allowed.
- Use the provided `logger` (`from src.logging import logger`) for logging messages.
  - You have five log levels available: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and
    `CRITICAL`, use them accordingly.

Moreover, each extension is required to export different objects and functions to work
properly. These are:

- `setup`: A function that sets up the extension. It CAN accept any of the following
  arguments, in the order you prefer, and you can safely omit any of them if you don't
  need them:

  - `bot`: The Discord bot instance.
  - `config`: The configuration dictionary for the extension. All config keys will
    always be lowercased for compatibility with environment variables.

- `setup_webserver`: A function for adding webserver routes. It CAN accept any of the
  following arguments, in the order you prefer, and you can safely omit any of them if
  you don't need them:
  - `app`: The Quart app instance.
  - `bot`: The Discord bot instance.
  - `config`: The configuration dictionary for the extension.

> [!NOTE] Either `setup` or `setup_webserver` is required for the extension to work
> properly. You can also provide both.

- `on_startup` (optional): An asynchronous function that is called when the bot starts.
  It CAN accept any of the following arguments, in the order you prefer, and you can
  safely omit any of them if you don't need them:

  - `app`: The Quart app instance.
  - `bot`: The Discord bot instance. :warning: The bot is not yet logged in, so you
    won't be able to send messages or interact with the Discord API.
  - `config`: The configuration dictionary for the extension.

- `default`: A dictionary containing the default configuration for the extension. This
  is used to populate the `config.yml` file with the default values if they aren’t
  already present. It is required to have AT MINIMAL the `enabled` key set to `False` or
  `True` (you generally want to prefer `True` for a more intuitive experience to new
  users, but it is not required, especially if you code just for yourself).
- `schema`: A dictionary (or a `schema.Schema`, if you want more granular control)
  containing the schema for the extension's configuration. This is used to validate the
  configuration in the `config.yml` file. The schema should be a dictionary where the
  keys are the configuration keys, and the values are the types of the values. For
  example:

```python
schema = {
    "enabled": bool,
    "token": str,
    "prefix": str,
    "channel": int,
    "role": int,
    "users": list,
    "options": dict,
}
```

We really encourage you to follow these instructions, even if you’re coding privately,
as it will make your code more readable and maintainable in the long run.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Botkit provides robust support for internationalization, allowing you to create
multi-language Discord bots with ease. Here's how to implement and use translations in
your extensions:

### Translation File Structure

Each extension can have its own `translations.yml` file located at
`src/extensions/EXT_NAME/translations.yml`. This file follows a specific structure:

```yaml
commands:
  command_name:
    name:
      en-US: Command Name
      fr: Nom de la Commande
      # ... other languages
    description:
      en-US: Command description
      fr: Description de la commande
      # ... other languages
    options:
      option_name:
        name:
          en-US: Option Name
          fr: Nom de l'Option
          # ... other languages
        description:
          en-US: Option description
          fr: Description de l'option
          # ... other languages
    strings:
      response_key:
        en-US: Response text in English
        fr: Texte de réponse en français
        # ... other languages

strings:
  string1:
    en-US: General string in English
    fr: Chaîne générale en français
  # ... other general strings
```

> [!NOTE] The top-level `strings` section (outside of `commands`) is what gets mapped to
> `config["translations"]`. This section is for general strings not directly tied to
> specific commands.

### Nested Commands and Sub-commands

For command groups and sub-commands, you can nest the structure using the `commands`
key:

```yaml
commands:
  parent_command:
    name:
      en-US: Parent Command
      # ... other languages
    description:
      en-US: Parent command description
      # ... other languages
    commands:
      sub_command:
        name:
          en-US: Sub Command
          # ... other languages
        description:
          en-US: Sub-command description
          # ... other languages
        # ... options, strings, etc.
```

This structure can be nested further for sub-sub-commands if needed.

### Accessing Translations in Code

1. For slash commands, options, and their descriptions, Botkit automatically applies the
   correct translations based on the guild's preferred locale.

2. For other strings, you can access translations using the `apply_locale` function:

```python
from src.i18n import apply_locale

# In your command or event handler:
translations = apply_locale(config["translations"], message.guild.preferred_locale)
response = translations.some_key.response_text

# You can also specify a default locale:
translations = apply_locale(config["translations"], message.guild.preferred_locale, default="en-US")
```

3. In slash commands, translations are available via the `ctx.translations` object:

```python
from src import custom
@discord.slash_command(name="ping")

async def ping(self, ctx: custom.ApplicationContext):
    response = ctx.translations.response.format(latency=round(self.bot.latency * 1000))
    await ctx.respond(response)
```

> [!NOTE] The translations available under `ctx.translations` are the ones set under
> `strings` in the command's translation.

### Best Practices

- Provide translations for all supported languages in your `translations.yml` file.
- Use meaningful keys for your strings to make the code more readable.
- Consider using placeholders (e.g., `{latency}`) in your translated strings for dynamic
  content.
- Always provide at least an English (en-US) translation as a fallback.

By following these guidelines, you can create a bot that seamlessly adapts to different
languages, providing a localized experience for users across various Discord servers.

## Using Patch Files

Botkit supports the use of patch files to modify or extend the functionality of the bot
or its dependencies before the main extension code runs. This is particularly useful for
applying global changes or monkey-patching existing classes.

### How It Works

1. Create a file named `patch.py` in your extension's directory.
2. Define a `patch()` function in this file. This function will be called before the
   extension is loaded.
3. The `patch()` function can modify global state, patch classes, or perform any other
   setup needed.

### Example: Error Handling Patch

Here's an example from the `nice-errors` extension that demonstrates how to use a patch
file to enhance error handling:

```python
# nice-errors/patch.py

import discord
from discord import Interaction
from discord.ui import Item
from typing_extensions import override

def patch():
  class PatchedView(discord.ui.View):
    @override
    async def on_error(
            self,
            error: Exception,
            item: Item,  # pyright: ignore[reportMissingTypeArgument,reportUnknownParameterType]
            interaction: Interaction,
    ) -> None:
      await handle_error(error, interaction, use_sentry_sdk=bool(sentry_sdk))

  discord.ui.View = PatchedView

```

This patch modifies the `discord.ui.View` class to provide more user-friendly error
messages. It catches exceptions and responds to the user with an appropriate message,
enhancing the overall user experience.

### When to Use Patch Files

Patch files are powerful but should be used judiciously. They are best suited for:

1. Applying global changes that affect multiple parts of your bot.
2. Modifying third-party libraries when you can't or don't want to fork them.
3. Implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging or error handling.

Remember that patches are applied early in the bot's lifecycle, so they can affect all
subsequent code. Use them carefully and document their effects clearly.

## Using scripts

### `check-listings`

This script checks the publishing status of your bot on various bot listing websites, as
well as if its description is up-to-date with one provided. To use it:

0. Have Google Chrome installed. This is required web scraping.
1. Install the development dependencies using `pdm install -d`.
2. Create a file called `description.md` in the root directory of the project,
   containing your bot's description.
3. Create a file called `listings.yml` in the root directory of the project, containing
   your bot's application id and url for _some_ listing websites, if you want to check
   them. Here's an example:

```yaml
application_id: 1234567891011121314

DiscordBotListCom: # add this section if you want to check discordbotlist.com
  url: https://discordbotlist.com/bots/my-bot

DisforgeCom: # add this section if you want to check disforge.com
  url: https://disforge.com/bot/1234-my-bot

DiscordMe: # add this section if you want to check discord.me
  url: https://discord.me/my-bot`
```

4. Run the script using `pdm run check-listings`.
