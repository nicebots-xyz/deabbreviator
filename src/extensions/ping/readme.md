# Ping Extension

The Ping extension is a straightforward, yet essential part of your Botkit. It doesn't
require any configuration and is **enabled** by default.

## Features

The Ping extension adds a `/ping` command to your bot. When this command is invoked, the
bot responds with a message indicating that it is online and operational. This can be
useful for quickly checking if your bot is responsive. The Ping extension also serves an
http endpoint at `/ping` that responds with a `200 OK` status code and the bot's name.

## Usage

To use the Ping extension type the `/ping` command. The bot should respond with a
message, confirming its online status. You can also send a `GET` request to the `/ping`
endpoint to check if the bot is online.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/ping
```

## Configuration

The Ping extension does not require any configuration. It is enabled by default. If you
wish to disable it, you can do so by setting its `enabled` key to `false` in the
`config.yml` file or through environment variables.
