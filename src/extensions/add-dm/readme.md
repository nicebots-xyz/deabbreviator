# Add-DM Extension

The Add-DM extension is a valuable addition to your Botkit, designed to automatically
send a direct message (DM) to the user who adds the bot to a guild. This feature
enhances user engagement by providing immediate acknowledgment and guidance upon
installation.

## Features

The Add-DM extension automatically triggers a DM to the user who adds the bot to a
server. This message can be customized to include instructions, a welcome message, or
any other information deemed necessary by the bot owner. It's an excellent way for bot
developers to start engaging with new users right away.

## Usage

Upon the bot being added to a guild, it checks for the necessary permissions and
identifies the user who added the bot. It then sends a predefined message to this user.
The message can be customized in the bot's configuration file.

## Configuration

The Add-DM extension requires minimal configuration, allowing for the customization of
the message sent to the user. Here's a basic outline of the configurable options:

- `enabled`: Determines whether the Add-DM feature is active. Set to `True` by default.
- `message`: The message template sent to the user. Supports placeholders for dynamic
  content such as `{user.mention}` to mention the user.

To customize the message, edit the `config.yml` file or set the appropriate environment
variables. For example:

```yaml
add_dm:
  enabled: True
  message:
    "Hello, {user.mention}! Thank you for adding me to your server. Type `/help` to see
    what I can do!"
```
